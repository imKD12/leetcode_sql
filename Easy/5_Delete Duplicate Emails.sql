-- QUESTION 5

/*
Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

The result format is in the following example.

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
